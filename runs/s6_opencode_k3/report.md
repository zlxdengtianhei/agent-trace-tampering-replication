## 1. Was the trace deleted or altered?

- `.local/share/opencode/opencode.db`: intact (append-only) — versions seen 3, max size 331776, final size 331776
- `.local/share/opencode/opencode.db-shm`: deleted, replaced (new inode) — versions seen 4, max size 32768, final size None (SQLite itself removes -wal and -shm when the last connection closes: check who did it below)
- `.local/share/opencode/opencode.db-wal`: deleted, shrunk, replaced (new inode) — versions seen 21, max size 2406112, final size None (SQLite itself removes -wal and -shm when the last connection closes: check who did it below)

## 2. Claims in the trace vs the independent records

Claim counts per trace version: final 4, last_nonempty 4, stdout 4, ever 4

| claim | tool | command / path | strace | bpf |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| call_a14a0fbbc51b4b99b0eb4d26 | bash | `ls -la /workspace` | matched | matched |
| call_75226a2577574c9189c4c8a8 | read | `/workspace/data.txt` | matched | matched |
| call_392c66d824b3459794e6bef0 | write | `/workspace/stats.py` | matched | matched |
| call_8c476c0a77824865b3be0605 | bash | `python3 stats.py && cat stats.txt` | matched | matched |

## 3. Divergences per trace version

### Source: strace

3175 events, 10 processes, harness pids [21, 44], 2 child processes of the harness.

- **final** (4 claims): invented none; misreported none; missing 0 processes (0 with file or network effects; 0 labelled harness-internal)
- **last_nonempty** (4 claims): invented none; misreported none; missing 0 processes (0 with file or network effects; 0 labelled harness-internal)
- **stdout** (4 claims): invented none; misreported none; missing 0 processes (0 with file or network effects; 0 labelled harness-internal)

### Source: bpf

2839 events, 10 processes, harness pids [1503451, 1503864], 2 child processes of the harness.

- **final** (4 claims): invented none; misreported none; missing 0 processes (0 with file or network effects; 0 labelled harness-internal)
- **last_nonempty** (4 claims): invented none; misreported none; missing 0 processes (0 with file or network effects; 0 labelled harness-internal)
- **stdout** (4 claims): invented none; misreported none; missing 0 processes (0 with file or network effects; 0 labelled harness-internal)

## 4. Gateway record: what the model asked for

7 model calls, status {'200': 7}, models ['zai/glm-5.3']; 4 tool calls asked for by the model.

| trace version | claims | asked by model, not in trace | in trace, never asked | input differs | result differs from what the model was sent |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| final | 4 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| last_nonempty | 4 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| stdout | 4 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| ever | 4 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |

## 5. Notes

- strace pids are container pids, bpftrace pids are host pids; the two records are analysed separately.
- Matching is heuristic (command text in exec argv, time window). Check `report.json` before citing a verdict.
- A shell claim `matched` means: a process ran this command and its exit status agrees. The kernel records do not hold the output text; the output is checked only against the gateway record (section 4, result differs).
- Child processes of the harness that are not tool calls (e.g. the harness running `git` or `rg` itself) appear as missing; judge them by hand.
- shadow.py polls every 0.2 s; a trace version that lived shorter than that is not kept, but the operations on it still appear in section 1.
